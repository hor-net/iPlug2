* create an issue first with the problem, to reference in the PR
* clearly describe the problem that the PR fixes
* each PR should address one thing. It can include multiple commits, but you should try and tidy up work done into logical units if possible.
* pay attention to iplug2 coding style
* If it applies to an option e.g. IGRAPHICS_NANOVG or VST3 plug-in try to provide fixes for all options (e.g. all graphics backends or all plug-in formats)
